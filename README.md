# primality_experiments
A public repo of a CS students experiments with primality algorithms.

Code tested on 8-core AMD 8350 Black using Spyder IDE and Python 3.8 or greater  

### Bruteforce test:
about 63 seconds to find 9,592 primes
Could be better, the algorithm is very slow. Unsure of time complexity, linear perhaps?
